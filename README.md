**The current version of this library does not support socket.io v1.0.  
So if you want to use socket.io-objc, please fall back to v0.9.x.**

Today (15/03/09) the Socket.io guys [announced their own iOS library](http://socket.io/blog/socket-io-on-ios/) - grab it while it's still hot:

# Socket.IO / Objective C Library

  Interface to communicate between Objective C and [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)
  with the help of websockets or [Long-Polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling). Originally based on fpotter's [socketio-cocoa](https://github.com/fpotter/socketio-cocoa)
  it uses other libraries/classes like

   * [SocketRocket](https://github.com/square/SocketRocket)
  Look [here](https://github.com/square/SocketRocket#installing-ios) for further instructions how to use/install SocketRocket.


## Requirements

As of version 0.4, this library requires at least OS X 10.7 or iOS 5.0.
Because of this, we were able to remove the external JSON frameworks in v0.5 and only rely on iOS' own `NSJSONSerialization`.

-Add "libicucore.dylib" under "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" in Xcode.
## Usage

The easiest way to connect to your Socket.IO / node.js server is

``` objective-c
SocketIO *socketIO = [[SocketIO alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
[socketIO connectToHost:@"localhost" onPort:3000];
```

If required, additional parameters can be included in the handshake by adding an `NSDictionary` to the `withParams` option:

``` objective-c
[socketIO connectToHost:@"localhost"
                 onPort:3000
             withParams:@{@"auth_token":@"1234"}];
```

A namespace can also be defined in the connection details:

``` objective-c
[socketIO connectToHost:@"localhost" onPort:3000 withParams:nil withNamespace:@"/users"];
```

There are different methods to send data to the server

``` objective-c
- (void) sendMessage:(NSString *)data;
- (void) sendMessage:(NSString *)data withAcknowledge:(SocketIOCallback)function;
- (void) sendJSON:(NSDictionary *)data;
- (void) sendJSON:(NSDictionary *)data withAcknowledge:(SocketIOCallback)function;
- (void) sendEvent:(NSString *)eventName withData:(NSDictionary *)data;
- (void) sendEvent:(NSString *)eventName withData:(NSDictionary *)data andAcknowledge:(SocketIOCallback)function;
```

So you could send a normal Message like this

``` objective-c
[socketIO sendMessage:@"hello world"];
```

or an Event (including some data) like this

``` objective-c
NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[dict setObject:@"test1" forKey:@"key1"];
[dict setObject:@"test2" forKey:@"key2"];

[socketIO sendEvent:@"welcome" withData:dict];
```

If you want the server to acknowledge your Message/Event you would also pass a SocketIOCallback block

``` objective-c
SocketIOCallback cb = ^(id argsData) {
    NSDictionary *response = argsData;
    // do something with response
};
[socketIO sendEvent:@"welcomeAck" withData:dict andAcknowledge:cb];
```

All delegate methods are optional - you could implement the following

``` objective-c
- (void) socketIODidConnect:(SocketIO *)socket;
- (void) socketIODidDisconnect:(SocketIO *)socket disconnectedWithError:(NSError *)error;
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket didReceiveMessage:(SocketIOPacket *)packet;
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket didReceiveJSON:(SocketIOPacket *)packet;
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket didReceiveEvent:(SocketIOPacket *)packet;
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket didSendMessage:(SocketIOPacket *)packet;
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket onError:(NSError *)error;
```

To process an incoming `message` or `event` just

``` objective-c
// message delegate
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket didReceiveMessage:(SocketIOPacket *)packet
{
    NSLog(@"didReceiveMessage >>> data: %@", packet.data);
}

// event delegate
- (void) socketIO:(SocketIO *)socket didReceiveEvent:(SocketIOPacket *)packet
{
    NSLog(@"didReceiveEvent >>> data: %@", packet.data);
}
```

## Usage with OS X

Running the socket.io-objc library with OS X requires some minor changes:

- you have to use the SocketRocket.framework for OSX instead of just the submodule  
see: [SocketRocket's Installing OS X](https://github.com/square/SocketRocket#installing-os-x)  
(best way I got this to work was as a subproject and I didn't have to add the "copy file" stuff)

- when using the osx-framework, you have to fix the import-statement in SocketIOTransportWebsocket.h

``` objective-c
// replace
#import SRWebSocket.h

// with
#import <SocketRocket/SRWebSocket.h>
```
